Full Stack Developer
--------------------

As a teenager in school, I was known for being the "computer guy." and was often asked for assistance on technical issues by staff members and classmates alike. Throughout my life I have been invested in a wide array of experiences ranging from graphic design, filmmaking, website development, to software development. However, through all my experiences there was mainly one field that captured my attention like no other and that was programming. My appetite for programming was so ambitious that I even went on to become the founder and president of my school's Coding Club I've had professional experience in being a website developer and a graphic designer for my school, supporting them in creating professional graphical content for their marketing campaigns and playing a crucial role in developing some of their websites. I have about 3 years of prior experience in programming tackling projects from making games all the way to developing a chat bot. I am extremely passionate about being developer, the satisfaction I attain from developing and deploying software is unmatched compared to any other. Software Devlopment to me is about creating intricate yet simple and efficient solutions to solve larger puzzles, to collaborate as a team to creative innovative and effective results, to make an application that delivers on all fronts, and as someone invested in creative problem-solving, there is no better calling for me then in the field of software development
